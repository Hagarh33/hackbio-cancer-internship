Overview:
Cancer is not just one disease but a complex group of more than 100 different diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Now we will focus on breast cancer in particular. Breast cancer is similar to them in that 1- abnormal cells grow 2- tumors can spread and become fatal. In 2022, 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 670,000 women died. These women could have been saved because this disease can be detected in its early stages and is not life-threatening. This disease can also affect men, but the percentage is very low. What are the factors that can increase the chances of developing breast cancer?
(Obesity- Alcohol- Family history- Exposure to radiation- Aging- Tobacco)
Why?
The most influential factor is family history
Mutations can occur in some genes that can lead to breast cancer such as: BRCA1, BRCA2
Symptoms:

What are the symptoms of the disease? It is worth noting that most of these symptoms do not appear in the early stages of the disease

(Breast lump - change in size - change in shape - redness - bloody discharge from the nipple.)

Breast lumps may not be a tumor, but it is necessary to visit a doctor immediately because if it is a tumor, it may spread over time to the lymph nodes under the armpit and may also spread to other organs such as the lungs - liver - bones. Once the disease reaches these organs, other symptoms and new pains appear such as bone pain or headaches

If the disease is discovered in the late stages, what is the procedure?


Treatment

Treatment depends on the extent of the tumor's spread in the body and is classified as follows:
1- Spread outside the breast to the lymph nodes (stage II or III)
2- To other parts of the body (stage IV).
Treatment is as follows:


By performing surgery to remove the tumor - radiotherapy - hormonal treatments - chemotherapy or biological treatments
Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages

Surgery may remove just the cancerous tissue or the whole breast
Now there are international organizations interested in reducing the number of deaths such as: Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI)
Its goal is to reduce the number of deaths annually by 2.5%, which means two and a half million people will not die from breast cancer and save their lifes.
